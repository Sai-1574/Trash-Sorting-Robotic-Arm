# Trash-Sorting-Robotic-Arm

A 5-DOF trash-sorting robotic arm that uses a YOLO object detector to classify items from a webcam/USB camera and an ESP32-driven arm (16-ch IÂ²C 12-bit servo driver) to pick & place items into appropriate bins (recyclable / non-recyclable / hazardous). The web UI is built with Streamlit showing the live camera and detection overlay.
